# Sorting algorithms

Java implementations of various sorting algorithms.

## Selection sort

Uses ~N<sup>2</sup>/2 compares and N exchanges to sort an array of length N.

## Insertion sort

Uses ~N<sup>2</sup>/4 compares and ~N<sup>2</sup>/4 exchanges to
sort a randomly ordered array of length N with distinct keys, on average.

## Examples

Build a jar file:

    $ ./gradlew assemble
